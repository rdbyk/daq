DAQ Toolbox for Scilab (Version 0.2.2)
======================================

DAQ Toolbox provides a rather direct interface to the NI-DAQmx Base 2.x
C API under Linux or Windows.

DAQ Toolbox can be used with NI-DAQmx 2.x/3.x or NI-DAQmx 8.x/9.x.

This is experimental software and it may contain numerous and severe bugs!

Requirements
============

- Linux/Windows
- NI-DAQmx Base 2.x/3.x or NI-DAQmx 8.x/9.x
- ScicosLab 4.4
- C-Compiler (GCC/Visual C++)

Installation
============

Please check the variables "cflags" and "ldflags" in file
"sci_gateway/buildsci_gateway.sce" and if necessary apply
appropriate changes for your NI-DAQmx installation.

To Install this toolbox:

We Suppose here that <PATH> stands for  the path of the directory
containing this readme.txt file.

- On Unix/Linux systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, once and for all, the following instruction 
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/builder.sce 
        This operation requires a C compiler and permission to
        write in 
        - <PATH>/sci_gateway to generate Makefile *.o, toto.a  files 
        - <PATH>/macros to generate *.bin, names and lib files
     * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/loader.sce 
        before using the toolbox, he  can also put it  in his
        .scilab startup file for automatic loading.

- On Windows systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, once and for all, the following instruction 
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>\builder.sce 
        This operation requires VisualC++ compiler and permission to
        write in 
         - <PATH>\src to generate Makefile *.obj, *.dll, ... files 
         - <PATH>\macros to generate *.bin, names and lib files 
     * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>\loader.sce
        before using the toolbox, he  can also put it  in his
        .scilab startup file for automatic loading.
